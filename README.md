# ScottyChat

ScottyChat is a Wechat chatbot simulating the CMU mascot Scotty using @itchat and the OpenAI toolbox. Specifially, it calls a free ChatGPT API to generate text and DALL-E API to generate an image of Scotty. It automatically sends an image of Scotty with text response printed on the image into `Your GC` when a message contains "scotty" or "Scotty". 

# Running the Script

Replace `Your GC` with the name of the Wechat groupchat you wish to send messages in.
Replace `Your image cache path` with your local path for images.
Replace `Your OpenAI API` with your OpenAI API key.
Run the script to activate Scotty.
